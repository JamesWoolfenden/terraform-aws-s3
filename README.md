# terraform-aws-s3 [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-aws-s3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-aws-s3) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-aws-s3.svg)](https://github.com/JamesWoolfenden/terraform-aws-s3/releases/latest)


Terraform module to provision a secure terraform s3 bucket.


---

This project uses the "build-harness" a modified version of the project ["SweetOps"](https://cpco.io/sweetops) from Cloudposse. Sweet indeed.


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).










## Usage

Include this repository as a module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
module "s3" {
source      = "JamesWoolfenden/s3/aws"
version     = "0.0.4"
common_tags = "${var.common_tags}"
}
```






## Usage

This creates an s3 bucket with policy and applies the common tags scheme.
The module uses a tagging scheme based on the map variable common_tags.
This needs to consist of as a minimum (in your _terraform.tfvars_):

```HCL
common_tags = {
    application = "terraform"
    module      = "s3"
    environment = "develop"
}
```
## Makefile Targets
```
Available targets:

  help/all:                          Display help for all targets
  help/short:                        This help short screen
  help:                              Help screen
  lint:                              Lint terraform code

```
